				<h1 class="text-center">About NutriTiger</h1>
				<p>
					NutriTiger is a web application that makes it easy for 
					Princeton students who eat in the dining halls to keep 
					track of their meals across all campus dining halls. 
					Not only can it show what each dining hall is offering 
					each day, but it will provide an in-depth breakdown of 
					each menu item's macronutrients and allow users to build 
					healthy habits and track their meals and nutrition 
					statistics. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly 
					platform to increase transparency between students and 
					Campus Dining, whilst providing a resource to track food 
					intake. NutriTiger was created by Oyu Enkhbold, 
					Rishabh Jain (lead), Eric Kurkowski, Jewel Merriman, and
					Stephanie Oh.

					data and an interface with the <a href = "https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/" target="_blank">USDA FoodData Central 
					Database.<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> For specific questions regarding our recipes, 
					reach out to Campus Dining's chefs and dietitians.  
					If you are struggling with or have concerns about an 
					eating disorder, we encourage you to seek guidance from 
					a qualified healthcare professional who can offer 
					customized assistance and support tailored to your 
					individual circumstances.
